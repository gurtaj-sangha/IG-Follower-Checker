# IG-Follower-Checker
The IG-Follower-Checker allows users to find the users in instagram that they follow, but the other account does not follow them back. I used selenium in the back-end to scrape the followers and following lists of the user. I used HTML/CSS for the front-end and used flask to connect the back-end with the front-end.
