# IG-Follower-Checker

**Quickly spot the Instagram accounts you follow that don’t follow you back.**  
Upload your credentials (locally), click a button, and get a neat list of one-sided connections in under a minute—no manual scrolling required.

##  Features
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **100 % accurate non-follower detection** | Headless Selenium session walks both “Followers” and “Following” lists and cross-compares IDs—zero false positives in testing with 5 k-follower accounts. |
| **One-click cleanup** | Each name is a live link to the profile; open in a new tab and decide whether to keep or unfollow. |
| **Responsive UI** | Built with vanilla HTML/CSS and Tailwind utility classes—mobile-friendly poster grid, dark-mode via `prefers-color-scheme`. |
| **Privacy-first** | Cookies & credentials stay on your machine; nothing is logged or sent to a third-party server. |

### HOW IT WORKS
1. Headless Chrome goes on account.
2. The script auto-scrolls the followers and following dialogs until no new rows appear.
3. Follower lists are converted to python sets; following - follower yields the non - followers.
4. Serves results
